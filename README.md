# Breast Cancer Classification – ML for Healthcare 🧠🩺

A supervised machine learning model developed to classify breast tumors as **benign** or **malignant** based on clinical features. The aim is to support early diagnosis and enhance medical decision-making in oncology.

## 📌 Overview
- Built a classification pipeline using Scikit-learn
- Applied feature selection and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Achieved **96% accuracy** on test data
- Emphasized explainability and clinical relevance

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Key Features
- Data cleaning & exploratory analysis
- Training models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Performance evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Visual outputs: Confusion matrix, ROC curve, feature importance

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mariee03/Breast-Cancer-Classification-ML-for-Healthcare.git
2. Open the notebook
      ```bash
   jupyter notebook breast_cancer_model.ipynb
3. Run all cells to reproduce the results
